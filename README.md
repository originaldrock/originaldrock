About Me

To say that Information Technology is a passion of mine is an understatement. I’ve been in the industry for nearly 10 years now and rarely have I considered my profession “work”. When your career basically revolves around playing with toys, refining them and improving them, or even building new toys altogether, it’s pretty rare to find me not in a good mood.

Currently, I’m a (Senior) Devops Engineer at Target Corporation. I've been in this role for a little over two years now after spending the two previous years as a Site Reliability Engineer.

Another fun fact about me is that I have ADHD. I like to make a point to mention this fact because I know there are many others our there with the same types of mental health struggles that I face and I feel that it's important to raise awareness.

If there is one thing that I have really taken to heart throughout my career, it's the realization of just how lucky I am that I ended up in a field that I enjoy. It's with this mindset that I started thinking about what I want to do in a more long term sense. For more detailed info about my career, please visit my resume at https://derricke.com/resume/.
